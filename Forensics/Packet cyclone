# Packet cyclone

The goal of this challenge was to analyze a set of Windows EVTX logs using [chainsaw](https://github.com/WithSecureLabs/chainsaw) in combination with the provided Sigma rules, in order to uncover the malicious usage of a tool called rclone. After downloading the tool and running the following command:

`./chainsaw hunt EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES/ -s SIGMA-RULES/ --mapping mappings/sigma-event-logs-all.yml`

we get a few detections of suspicious events. Connecting to the docker instance of HTB, we have to answer some questions about our collected findings before we can have our flag. Below is a screenshot of all the correct answers:
