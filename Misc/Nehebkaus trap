# Nehebkaus trap

This challenge involved breaking out of a restricted Python shell interpreter. Basically we can only input commands that don't contain certain special characters. The list (actually a Python tuple) containing these characters is contained in a global variable that we can view using `print(globals())`:

After a lot of failed attempts at it, I came up with a solution consisting of the following sequence of commands:

- `exec(input())`
- `globals()['BLACKLIST']=list(globals()['BLACKLIST'])`
- `exec(input())`
- `globals()['BLACKLIST’]=[]`
- `print(open(“flag.txt”,”r”).read())`

What this does is:

- converting the tuple into a list so we can change it later (we can't actually delete it right away since the program will crash);
- empty the list;
- output the flag file content.
